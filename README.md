## Indicator Features

The Currency Index Pro indicator has the following features:

- Calculates and plots the currency index pro values.
- Provides a comprehensive view of the strength or weakness of a currency.
- Uses 65 functions to calculate the currency index pro values.
- Can be used on any currency pair and timeframe.

## Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is the initialization function of the custom indicator. It sets the indicator window properties and creates the Currency Index Pro window. The indicator window properties are set using the `IndicatorSetString()` and `IndicatorSetInteger()` functions. The Currency Index Pro window is created using the `WindowCreate()` function. The `WindowSetOnMove()` function is used to handle the window move event.

## Indicator Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is the deinitialization function of the custom indicator. It is called when the indicator is removed from the chart. In this function, the Currency Index Pro window is destroyed using the `WindowDestroy()` function.

## Currency Index Pro Window Move Event Handler

The `CIP_OnMove()` function is the event handler for the Currency Index Pro window move event. It is called when the window is moved. In this function, the window position is updated and the window is redrawn using the `WindowRedraw()` function.

## Indicator Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is the iteration function of the custom indicator. It is called on each tick to calculate and plot the currency index pro values. In this function, the `CalculateCurrencyIndexPro()` function is called to calculate the currency index pro values. The calculated values are then plotted on the chart using the `PlotIndex()` function.

## Currency Index Pro Calculation

The `CalculateCurrencyIndexPro()` function is responsible for calculating the currency index pro values. The implementation of the calculation algorithm is not provided in this code. It is recommended to refer to the official developer or MQL5 for the detailed calculation algorithm.

## Plotting Currency Index Pro Values

The `PlotIndex()` function is used to plot the currency index pro values on the chart. It takes the index, value, and label as parameters and plots the value at the specified index with the specified label.
